# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

V. Isualize has given out a new assignment - to analyze and compare how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to make business decisions at PyBer. To begin the analysis, I will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

#### By analyzing the "Total Fare by City Type" multi line graph below we can clearly see the differences in ride sharing data by city type:

- The total fares are the highest in urban  cities and the lowest in rural cities. The difference between the total far dollar amount between these two city types is extremely significant. 

- Suburban cities fall nearly in the middle of the total fares of urban and rural cities.

- From Jan-Apr the total fare amounts continuously vary, however, the variation is never more than $500.

## Summary

#### Based on the results, I have three recommendations for the PyBer CEO:

- Increase PyBer marketing to target rural and suburban cities and increase riders.

- Increase the number of drivers in suburban citites to keep fares at an affordable rate so no customers are lost due to soaring prices.

- Increase drivers in rural areas to decrease the average fare per ride.
